        <br />

        <p>
          Nutrition is the study of nutrients in food, how the body uses them,
          and the relationship between diet, health, and disease.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nutrition focuses on how people can use dietary choices to reduce the
          risk of disease, what happens if a person has too much or too little
          of a nutrient, and how allergies work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nutrients provide nourishment. Proteins, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins,
          minerals, fiber, and water are all nutrients. If people do not have
          the right balance of nutrients in their diet, their risk of developing
          certain health conditions increases.
        </p>

        <h2>Macronutrients</h2>

        <p>
          Macronutrients are nutrients that people need in relatively large
          quantities.
        </p>

        <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>

        <p>Sugar, starch, and fiber are types of carbohydrates.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Sugars</strong> are simple carbs. The body quickly breaks down
          and absorbs sugars and processed starch. They can provide rapid
          energy, but they do not leave a person feeling full. They can also
          cause a spike in blood sugar levels. Frequent sugar spikes increase
          the risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Fiber</strong> is also a carbohydrate. The body breaks down
          some types of fiber and uses them for energ; others are metabolized by
          gut bacteria, while other types pass through the body.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Fiber and unprocessed starch</strong> are complex carbs. It
          takes the body some time to break down and absorb complex carbs. After
          eating fiber, a person will feel full for longer. Fiber may also
          reduce the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal
          cancer. Complex carbs are a more healthful choice than sugars and
          refined carbs.
        </p>

        <h3>Proteins</h3>

        <p>
          Proteins consist of amino acids, which are organic compounds that
          occur naturally.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are 20 amino acids. Some of these are essential, which means
          people need to obtain them from food. The body can make the others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some foods provide complete protein, which means they contain all the
          essential amino acids the body needs. Other foods contain various
          combinations of amino acids.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most plant-based foods do not contain complete protein, so a person
          who follows a vegan diet needs to eat a range of foods throughout the
          day that provides the essential amino acids.
        </p>

        <h3>Fats</h3>

        <p>Fats are essential for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>lubricating joints</li>
          <li>helping organs produce hormones</li>
          <li>enabling the body to absorb certain vitamins</li>
          <li>reducing inflammation</li>
          <li>preserving brain health</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Too much fat can lead to obesity, high cholesterol, liver disease, and
          other health problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the type of fat a person eats makes a difference. Unsaturated
          fats, such as olive oil, are more healthful than saturated fats, which
          tend to come from animals.
        </p>

        <h3>Water</h3>

        <p>
          The adult human body is up to 60% water, and it needs water for many
          processes. Water contains no calories, and it does not provide energy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many people recommend consuming 2 liters, or 8 glasses, of water a
          day, but it can also come from dietary sources, such as fruit and
          vegetables. Adequate hydration will result in pale yellow urine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Requirements will also depend on an individual’s body size and age,
          environmental factors, activity levels, health status, and so on.
        </p>

        <h2>Micronutrients</h2>

        <p>
          Micronutrients are essential in small amounts. They include vitamins
          and minerals. Manufacturers sometimes add these to foods. Examples
          include fortified cereals and rice.
        </p>

        <h2>Micronutrients</h2>
        <p>
          Micronutrients are essential in small amounts. They include vitamins
          and minerals. Manufacturers sometimes add these to foods. Examples
          include fortified cereals and rice.
        </p>

        <h3>Minerals</h3>
        <p>The body needs carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.</p>
        <p>
          It also needs dietary minerals, such as iron, potassium, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases, a varied and balanced diet will provide the minerals a
          person needs. If a deficiency occurs, a doctor may recommend
          supplements.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some of the minerals the body needs to function well.</p>

        <h3>Potassium</h3>
        <p>
          Potassium is an electrolyte. It enables the kidneys, the heart, the
          muscles, and the nerves to work properly. The 2015–2020 Dietary
          Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults consume 4,700
          milligrams (mg) of potassium each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too little can lead to high blood pressure, stroke, and kidney stones.
        </p>
        <p>Too much may be harmful to people with kidney disease.</p>
        <p>
          Avocados, coconut water, bananas, dried fruit, squash, beans, and
          lentils are good sources.
        </p>

        <h3>Sodium</h3>
        <p>Sodium is an electrolyte that helps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>maintain nerve and muscle function</li>
          <li>regulate fluid levels in the body</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Too little can lead to hyponatremia. Symptoms include lethargy,
          confusion, and fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too much can lead to high blood pressure, which increases the risk of
          cardiovascular disease and stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
          Table salt, which is made up of sodium and chloride, is a popular
          condiment. However, most people consume too much sodium, as it already
          occurs naturally in most foods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts urge people not to add table salt to their diet. Current
          guidelines recommend consuming no more than 2,300 mg of sodium a day,
          or around one teaspoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          This recommendation includes both naturally-occurring sources, as well
          as salt a person adds to their food. People with high blood pressure
          or kidney disease should eat less.
        </p>

        <h3>Calcium</h3>
        <p>
          The body needs calcium to form bones and teeth. It also supports the
          nervous system, cardiovascular health, and other functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too little can cause bones and teeth to weaken. Symptoms of a severe
          deficiency include tingling in the fingers and changes in heart
          rhythm, which can be life-threatening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too much can lead to constipation, kidney stones, and reduced
          absorption of other minerals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current guidelines for adults recommend consuming 1,000 mg a day, and
          1,200 mg for women aged 51 and over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good sources include dairy products, tofu, legumes,and green, leafy
          vegetables.
        </p>

        <h3>Phosphorus</h3>
        <p>
          Phosphorus is present in all body cells and contributes to the health
          of the bones and teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too little phosphorus can lead to bone diseases, affect appetite,
          muscle strength, and coordination. It can also result in anemia, a
          higher risk of infection, burning or prickling sensations in the skin,
          and confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too much in the diet is unlikely to cause health problems though
          toxicity is possible from supplements, medications, and phosphorus
          metabolism problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adults should aim to consume around 700 mg of phosphorus each day.
          Good sources include dairy products, salmon, lentils, and cashews.
        </p>

        <h3>Magnesium</h3>
        <p>
          Magnesium contributes to muscle and nerve function. It helps regulate
          blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and it enables the body to
          produce proteins, bone, and DNA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too little magnesium can eventually lead to weakness, nausea,
          tiredness, restless legs, sleep conditions, and other symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>Too much can result in digestive and, eventually, heart problems.</p>
        <p>
          Nuts, spinach, and beans are good sources of magnesium. Adult females
          need 320 mg of magnesium each day, and adult males need 420 mg.
        </p>

        <h3>Zinc</h3>
        <p>
          Zinc plays a role in the health of body cells, the immune system,
          wound healing, and the creation of proteins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too little can lead to hair loss, skin sores, changes in taste or
          smell,and diarrhea, but this is rare.
        </p>
        <p>Too much can lead to digestive problems and headaches.</p>
        <p>
          Adult females need 8 mg of zinc a day, and adult males need 11 mg.
          Dietary sources include oysters, beef, fortified breakfast cereals,
          and baked beans.
        </p>

        <h3>Iron</h3>
        <p>
          Iron is crucial for the formation of red blood cells, which carry
          oxygen to all parts of the body. It also plays a role in forming
          connective tissue and creating hormones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too little can result in anemia, including digestive issues, weakness,
          and difficulty thinking. Learn more here about iron deficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too much can lead to digestive problems, and very high levels can be
          fatal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good sources include fortified cereals, beef liver, lentils, spinach,
          and tofu. Adults need 8 mg of iron a day, but females need 18 mg
          during their reproductive years.
        </p>

        <h3>Manganese</h3>
        <p>
          The body uses manganese to produce energy, it plays a role in blood
          clotting, and it supports the immune system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too little can result in weak bones in children, skin rashes in men,
          and mood changes in women.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too much can lead to tremors, muscle spasms, and other symptoms, but
          only with very high amounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mussels, hazelnuts, brown rice, chickpeas, and spinach all provide
          manganese. Male adults need 2.3 mg of manganese each day, and females
          need 1.8 mg.
        </p>

        <h3>Copper</h3>
        <p>
          Copper helps the body make energy and produce connective tissues and
          blood vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too little copper can lead to tiredness, patches of light skin, high
          cholesterol, and connective tissue disorders. This is rare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too much copper can result in liver damage, abdominal pain, nausea,
          and diarrhea. Too much copper also reduces the absorption of zinc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good sources include beef liver, oysters, potatoes, mushrooms, sesame
          seeds, and sunflower seeds. Adults need 900 micrograms (mcg) of copper
          each day.
        </p>

        <h3>Selenium</h3>
        <p>
          Selenium is made up of over 24 selenoproteins, and it plays a crucial
          role in reproductive and thyroid health. As an antioxidant, it can
          also prevent cell damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too much selenium can cause garlic breath, diarrhea, irritability,
          skin rashes, brittle hair or nails, and other symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Too little can result in heart disease, infertility in men, and
          arthritis.
        </p>
        <p>Adults need 55 mcg of selenium a day.</p>
        <p>
          Brazil nuts are an excellent source of selenium. Other plant sources
          include spinach, oatmeal, and baked beans. Tuna, ham, and enriched
          macaroni are all excellent sources.
        </p>

        <h2>Vitamins</h2>
        <p>
          People need small amounts of various vitamins. Some of these, such as
          vitamin C, are also antioxidants. This means they help protect cells
          from damage by removing toxic molecules, known as free radicals, from
          the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitamins can be:
          <br />
          <strong>Water-soluble:</strong> The eight B vitamins and vitamin C
          <br />
          <strong>Fat-soluble: Vitamins A, D, E, and K</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Water soluble vitamins</h3>
        <p>
          People need to consume water-soluble vitamins regularly because the
          body removes them more quickly, and it cannot store them easily.
        </p>

        <h3>Fat-soluble vitamins</h3>
        <p>
          The body absorbs fat-soluble vitamins through the intestines with the
          help of fats (lipids). The body can store them and does not remove
          them quickly. People who follow a low-fat diet may not be able to
          absorb enough of these vitamins. If too many build up, problems can
          arise.

          Multivitamins are available for purchase in stores or online, but
          people should speak to their doctor before taking any supplements, to
          check that they are suitable for them to use.
        </p>

        <h2>Antioxidants</h2>
        <p>
          Some nutrients also act as antioxidants. These may be vitamins,
          minerals, proteins, or other types of molecules. They help the body
          remove toxic substances known as free radicals, or reactive oxygen
          species. If too many of these substances remain in the body, cell
          damage and disease can result.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Nutrition is the study of food and how it affects the body. People
          need to consume a varied diet to obtain a wide range of nutrients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people choose to follow a specific diet, in which they focus on
          certain foods and avoid others. People who do this may need to plan
          carefully to ensure they obtain all the necessary vitamins to maintain
          their health.
        </p>
        <p>
          A diet that is rich in plant-based foods and that limits added animal
          fats, processed foods, and added sugar and salt is most likely to
          benefit a person’s health.
        </p>

        <h2>Here are some reasons why nutrition is important:</h2>
        <p>
          Good nutrition has a direct impact on your overall health and quality
          of life. When you follow a healthy diet that consists of fruits,
          vegetables and whole grains, you aren’t just satisfying your
          hunger—you’re nourishing your body too. Although it’s okay to indulge
          once in a while (we’ve all been there!), it’s crucial to keep track of
          what you eat so you can maintain a healthy lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h3>DECREASES THE CHANCE OF DEVELOPING VARIOUS DISEASES</h3>
        <p>
          Having quality eating habits can reduce your risk of developing
          certain diseases that could severely impact your health. Among these
          maladies are hypertension, diabetes and heart disease, which was the
          leading cause of death in the United States in 2014, according to the
          Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you want to increase
          your chances of staying well, it’s best to stick to a healthy diet.
        </p>

        <h3>HELPS KEEP A HEALTHY WEIGHT</h3>
        <p>
          Eating natural food instead of processed foods can have a positive
          effect on your weight. Plus, your weight also influences your overall
          health. For example, being overweight raises your risk of developing
          Type II diabetes. It can also harm your joints, limiting your
          mobility.
        </p>

        <h3>INCREASES ENERGY LEVELS</h3>
        <p>
          Have you ever eaten a bunch of junk food and experienced a sudden jolt
          of energy, only to feel completely exhausted a short time later? That
          is how your body reacts when you absorb an abundant amount of refined
          sugar. By avoiding such unhealthy foods and fueling your body with
          nutritious options instead, you’ll be able to increase your energy
          levels throughout the entire day, not just for an hour or so—and you
          won’t endure that crash-and-burn effect. You’ll be able to focus on
          what’s going on around you rather than on how tired you feel. So, put
          down that candy bar and pick up a piece of fruit that contains natural
          sugars!
        </p>

        <h3>IMPROVES SKIN HEALTH</h3>
        <p>
          Good nutrition doesn’t just affect your weight or your energy. It can
          also play a role in the health of your skin. According to the American
          Academy of Dermatology, foods that contain vitamins C and E, lycopene
          and other antioxidants, as well as olive oil, can help to protect your
          skin against sun damage.
        </p>

        <h3>BOOSTS IMMUNE SYSTEM</h3>
        <p>
          When you practice good nutrition, you’re consuming natural and healthy
          foods that can help your body. This includes improving your immune
          system. According to a 2011 study presented at the 5th International
          Immunonutrition Workshop in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, researchers
          showed how obesity can weaken someone’s immune system, thereby
          increasing the chances of getting sick from infections.
        </p>

        <p>
          The choices you make when you eat don’t affect just one part of your
          body—like your stomach. There’s your heart, your brain and your skin
          to consider, too. Good nutrition can benefit you on many levels. It’s
          one of the best ways to improve your health and your quality of life.
          And that’s important.
